CCV Shop has tons of features and integrations but of course there can always be
more. It’s simply not possible for us to create everything we think of. That’s were
you, an App developer, come in. Each webshop provides a powerful API and
webhooks with which you can interface to connect your software to any CCV Shop.
You could connect all kinds of third party software. Anything from accounting
software to loyalty programs, from social-sharing to product management software.
Within the backend each merchant has access to the App Store. Currently the App
Store already contains multiple apps in several categories, all adding or extending
the functionality of the webshop. Some of these apps were developed by us, some
were developed by App developers like yourself. The App Store is a great place for
us to show all the extras merchants can get for their webshops.
An App itself doesn’t ‘do’ so much. It’s assumed that you already have working
software that utilizes the API and webhooks to create the feature. The App is
designed to integrate your software into the App Store and purely facilitate in the
installation and configuration.
